Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router, and Context.

Hello! It is time to start doing professional front-end applications. This time
we will be creating a small contact management application that allows users to:
Read, Create, Update and Delete contacts. 

You may use this gif: [Check it out here!](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-contact-list/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

Or you can use these images:

### :memo: This project is divided in: 

#### :two: different views: 

1. Contact: Contains the list of contacts.
2. AddContact: It's just a form used to create or update contacts.

#### One component:
ContactCard: displays just one contact.

## TO-DO functionalities

- You have to add the code needed to make your application handle contacts, specifically: 
    - create, 
    - update, 
    - and delete.
- (Optional) Ask the user for confirmation before deleting, use the Modal component for that.

All the functionalities must be implemented in the ```actions``` object (store.js).

Hint: start with some dummy content in the store (store.js).

```Fetch``` the data from the API: https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/fake/contact/

Hint: Use Postman to try the API endpoints before coding.  

That is it! Start coding your React Application :)
